Docstring for reverse_sub_array
Given an array arr, you need to reverse a subarray of that array. The range of this subarray is given by indices l and r (1-based indexing).

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], l = 2, r = 4
Output: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7]
Explanation: After reversing the elements in range 2 to 4 (2, 3, 4), modified array is 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7.
Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 7, 4], l = 1, r = 4
Output: [4, 7, 6, 1]
Explanation: After reversing the elements in range 1 to 4 (1, 6, 7, 4), modified array is 4, 7, 6, 1.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ arr.size()

        # convert to 0-based indices
        left = l - 1
        right = r - 1

        # reverse in-place using two pointers
        while left < right:
            arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
            left += 1
            right -= 1

        return arr
