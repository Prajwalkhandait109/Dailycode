'''
You are given an array arr. Find the sum of distinct elements in an array.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 15
Explanation: Distinct elements are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So sum is 15.
Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
Output: 5
Explanation: Only Distinct element is 5. So sum is 5.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
